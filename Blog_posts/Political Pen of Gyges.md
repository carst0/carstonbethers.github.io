Who is evil, Republicans or Democrats?

Typically, it’s Republicans when they are in power, and Democrats when they are in power.

So, they’re both evil\!\!\!

No—well, maybe—but I would argue that they are both weaker than they are evil. A problem that can be remedied by *lightening* the load.

Let me explain by sharing Plato’s story, *The Ring of Gyges.*

Very simply, a shepherd named Gyges finds a ring that gives him the ability to become invisible. This invisibility allows him to commit crimes without being punished. After Gyges learns the power of the ring, he has a decision to make: should he keep living as he is and not use the ring to subvert justice, or should he use the ring and get away with whatever he wants?

Plato crafted this story so we could discuss whether people act justly because of the potential negative consequences (which vanish with the ring), or if acting justly is a reward in itself.

Plato concludes that acting justly is a reward in itself, and that to be happiest, Gyges should not use the ring to do wrong.

I agree with Plato because I feel happiest when I act justly… but I live in a world with consequences\! I do not know what it would be like to wear the ring—so maybe it *is* better\!

I think it is important to note that Gyges (in his right mind) would probably rather someone keep the ring away from him than let him or anyone else get hold of it. I believe this burden is too heavy for most humans. Most are unable to harness transcendent power without being corrupted by it.

Today, we have what I will call *The Pen of Gyges.*

Once every four years, we vote for someone to sit in a powerful seat and lead our nation\! Now, our founding fathers were smart, so they made sure the seat-sitter had limits on their power, imposed by the other branches of government (legislative and judicial). They called this genius plan “checks and balances,” or CB for short. (Those are my initials\! I’m famous\!)

There is a problem, though. Since the foundation of our nation, we have seen the effective power of the seat-sitter grow due to sneaky tactics. The main one is the signing of Executive Orders by the president. Executive Orders, by definition, require no action by Congress and can go into effect immediately, until the judicial branch deems them illegal. So you can sign any Executive Order you want, and it will last at least until the judges get to work\! (And technically, the judicial branch has no power to enforce the law, so one day we might see a president just ignore the ruling—if we haven’t already.)

This tactic is dangerous, especially combined with the seat-sitter’s ability to pardon the convicted. It gives a metaphorical “Pen of Gyges” to whoever is in the seat, because just like the ring, the pen allows you to do anything you want without repercussions. Spooky stuff. 

So who is evil? Republicans or Democrats?? I think they are both weaker than they are evil, and the pen has become too powerful for either to weild. 

Should we send the pen to the bottom of the ocean??

Well it doesn't matter what you think about that because it's not going to happen.

So, when we have one political tool that has become disproportionately powerful, what are our options? Weaken it by strengthening the political tools that seek to check its power, restoring the balance.

What does this look like? How do you strengthen the Legislative and Judicial branches in the right way? I don’t know\! Send me your ideas\!

Here is a random note from class that apparently will be a test question... it will live here forever now.
