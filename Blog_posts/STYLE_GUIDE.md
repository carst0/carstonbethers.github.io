# Blog Post Style Guide

## Frontmatter Structure
Every blog post should begin with frontmatter enclosed in triple dashes (---):
```yaml
---
title: Your Title Here
date: YYYY-MM-DD
preview: A compelling 1-2 sentence preview of your post
reading_time: estimated minutes to read
tags: [primary-tag, topic1, topic2, topic3]
---
```

## Heading Structure
- Use ## for main sections (H2)
- Use ### for subsections (H3)
- Never use single # (H1) as this is reserved for the title
- Keep heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)

## Content Guidelines
1. **Introduction**
   - Start with a hook
   - Provide context
   - Set expectations for what readers will learn

2. **Main Content**
   - Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
   - Include examples and analogies
   - Break up long sections with subheadings
   - Use lists and bullet points for better readability

3. **Formatting**
   - Use **bold** for emphasis
   - Use *italics* for terms or concepts
   - Use `code blocks` for technical terms
   - Use > for notable quotes
   - Use --- for section breaks (sparingly)

4. **Lists**
   - Use bullet points (-) for unordered lists
   - Use numbers (1.) for ordered lists
   - Indent sublists with 2 spaces

## Writing Style
- Use active voice
- Keep sentences concise
- Maintain consistent tense
- Use Oxford comma
- Write conversationally but professionally
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Define technical terms
- Link to relevant resources

## Examples and Analogies
- Start complex topics with familiar examples
- Use analogies to explain difficult concepts
- Provide real-world applications
- Include personal experiences when relevant

## Conclusion
- Summarize key points
- Provide actionable takeaways
- End with a thought-provoking question or call to action

## Tags
Common tags to consider:
- Topic areas: [philosophy, technology, business, society]
- Concepts: [analysis, personal-growth, innovation]
- Skills: [leadership, communication, problem-solving]
- Domains: [psychology, economics, politics]

## File Naming
- Use lowercase
- Replace spaces with underscores
- Use descriptive but concise names
- Example: `understanding_empathy.md`

## Images and Media
- Store images in `/Blog_posts/images/`
- Use descriptive file names
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Optimize images for web
