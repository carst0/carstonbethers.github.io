With the rise of the MoltBot and MoltBook, we have been given a glimpse of the future, and more importantly, what we need to build for the future to become the present. We need to build structure.

LLMs are like humans, after all many of them have been trained on human like output (writing).

If LLMs are like humans, maybe we should treat them like humans.

Humans do better work when they have structure. Do this, then that, and after that make sure to do this, all while keeping this in mind.

Some forms of structure have been proven to be better than the others.

Great companies have great structure. Everyone knows what they do; important meetings happen at the right intervals. Nothing big is changed unless someone at the top (the visionary) says so.

So if LLMs are like humans, and we want to make this technology as useful as possible we might want to figure out the best way to structure it… or them.

The answer is to let them go to meetings. Let them become Corporate. (Corporations are AI <3)

MoltBook is the genesis. Could you take job oriented bots, assign them to meetings, let them hash it out and make decisions, and then let them act? This is essentially what a Corporation does but current corporations employ brains that are on top of a human body.

Tomorrow's corporations will be much leaner with one human in charge, the visionary/President of the Board, with hundreds of AI gents all meeting together to discuss the strategy, and more humans doing the actual thing, that is until humanoids replace them.

I think this is step 1 to LLMs being more useful.
