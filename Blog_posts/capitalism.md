## Definitions/Assumptions

- **Economic system**: A society's reward system
- **Capitalism**: an economic system
- **Fundamental Success of Economic System**: Increased Standard of Living
- **Byproduct of successful Economic System**: Increased Profits
- **How to measure the progress of society**: The % of human capital spent on innovation

## Introduction

I love capitalism, it is what I believe to be the greatest economic system us humans have sustained so far. I believe it is our best bet for advancing our society. For fun, I wanted to do a thought experiment to check out some of the systemic flaws with it. When does capitalism fall short of success? My argument hinges on the fact that as humans, we have a hard time with the law of byproducts. In this case, this means that we search for profits before we seek to increase the standard of living. 

## Key Arguments

1. Building a better mouse trap creates high profits… until marketing gets involved.
2. Innovation is a long term goal. Our leaders are currently rewarded based on short term goals. This creates more problems that take more human capital away from innovation, stagnating societal success.

## Argument 1: The Marketing Paradox

Ralph Waldo Emerson said "Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door." Is it always true? Our children wish it was. Let me explain. 

In our day the saying is more like "Build a better marketing campaign, and the world will buy your thing" or "Convince a large population that this cheap thing is as good as the more expensive, quality thing, and you will sell millions… for a while". The founder of Temu subscribes to the ladder.

In a perfect world, humans would get all the value of capitalism by making buying decisions based on logic. Their internal monologue would be something like, "This is a quality good and will last me a long time, maybe I will pay a few extra dollars on it." Instead, humans buy things based on emotions. Enter Marketers. 

Marketers are just psychologists who realized where the money really is. They understand human behaviors and can direct our attention and emotions to products where their cost is mixed into the price. Here is the foundational logic that tells us that marketers turn capitalism into a profit game instead of a progress game.

Let's pretend there are two hammer companies:
- **HammerI**: The hammer industry standard
  - American made steel hammers
  - Extremely high quality, lasting decades
  - Cost: $20, Selling price: $20

- **Hammer2**: The new market entrant
  - Hired marketing company (increasing costs to $21)
  - Switched to lower quality steel to reduce costs
  - Final cost: $15, Selling price: $19
  - Product lifespan: 5 years vs HammerI's 50 years

The result? HammerI is forced to lower quality to compete, leading to:
- Diminished overall product quality
- Increased waste
- More workers in unnecessary positions
- Decreased societal progress

### Objection 1
This diminishing of quality is a cycle that restarts when someone innovates and creates a better hammer. The diminishing of quality can actually prove an effective way to get most of the benefits of that technology for a fraction of the price.

## Argument 2: The Short-Term Leadership Problem

Innovation is a long term goal. Our leaders are currently rewarded based on short term goals. This creates more problems that take more human capital away from innovation, stagnating societal success.

As I said earlier, in a perfect world humans get the most out of capitalism when they use logic, but we instead use emotion. This pushes leaders to seek short term gains that are driven by fear and personal safety instead of the long term gains that are driven by optimism and industry longevity. 

### The McDonald's Case Study

- Average CEO tenure since 1998: 3.6 years
- 7 CEOs since 1998
- Store count increased 4x
- Market cap only increased 2.3x (inflation-adjusted)

The consequences:
- Degraded food quality
- Increased health issues
- Creation of reactive industries (weight loss, health services)
- Misallocation of human capital

### Objection 2
[Awaiting strong counterarguments from readers]

## Solution

Be a leader who is aware of these problems:
- Value innovation over profitability
- Search for long term goals over short term goals
- Don't be selfish, be a steward
