Here is a portion of my mind right now. This is not perfectly portrayed but it will give a good idea where I am at. 

I have been offered a founding role at a pre-launch startup that would create meme coins for College football players. Ideally people will trade these coins based on their perceived value of that player. There is a 1.5% fee every time a token is traded and 0.3% of that goes to the player themselves. 

Here are some pros: 
- The market tells you who the most valuable players are, giving players public rankings. This is important for trading and game schedules and gives rational for pushback on committee decisions. 
- The players get another source of revenue for their good performance. Currently any predictions based on player performance do not give the player a cut.
- Individuals who recognize underappreciated players can make money while helping that player gain recognition. 

Some Cons:
- Many people see speculative investing as gambling. Gambling is addicting.
- People can lose a lot of money.
- The players are rewarded on market volatility. This can lead to deceit.
- I don't know if I want to be known as the guy who started this.

Now let me tell you where my brain is at, and why this decision is harder than it seems. 

There is a line from chamath that says "Get the money... and then lets get around a table and lets create new rules... It is going to be made, it is going to be allocated, and you have a moral imperative to make sure that if you have a point of view that matters and you want to reflect it, you get it."

What is the easiest way to make money? Sell your body. Ok, I'm not talking about that but...kinda. The easiest way to make money is to sell something that hijacks the human condition. Investing culture, or maybe better put, gambling culture is a total virus in our society today. People are ruining not only their own lives, but the lives of others because of it.

I want to make a bunch of money, but am unsure about this "information market" strategy. 

So the question is, would you lie down with the pigs to make a bunch of money so you can then clean up the pigsty?

Depends.

Some things only have one option.
The only option to save mankind was the condescension and Atonement of Jesus Christ.
The good thing is that there is not one way to make a bunch of money.

Because of my proximity to the idea, it is easy to think that this is the only way to make a bunch of money.

I need to think with a more abundant mindset. There are many great businesses that have not been built that I can build or help build that will help me "get the money." I believe my eyes are learning to see them, but I can't see them quite yet. 

Here is where my hope lays.

I believe in God. I believe he wants the best for us. 

I think he might be training me to see more clearly.

It's like he has gifted me corrective glasses. They are painful to wear and when I wear them I can't see as well as before. But this is just part of the process to having better vision. 

I think there is a certain period where my vision is changing, where I am learning how to be a better founder, and yet I feel like I am blind and a horrible founder. Often I feel like I need to just throw away all that I have been learning and retardmaxx. Yet, I have faith that if I go through this period and stay the course, if I keep the corrective glasses on, only then I will come out with perfect vision, a better company, and a seat at the table.

"In the end, there will only be two types of people. Those who say to God "Thy will be done" and those to whom God says, in the end "Thy will be done." - C.S. Lewis

In order for me to say "Thy will be done" I feel like I need this corrective process. It is hard. It is taxing. It is confusing.

I believe it will be worth it.

Now forgive me as I walk into yet another wall with my corrective glasses on.
