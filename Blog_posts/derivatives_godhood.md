## The Path to Divinity

I believe all of us have the potential to become Gods. If that is our ultimate goal, then we must search for the path that will get us there. I believe that path can be simplified into small, daily acts of progression. So the real questions become: "How do I maximize my progression?" and "How do I avoid stalling or reversing it?" Today, I want to focus on the latter—helping us frame progression honestly, so we can recognize it for what it truly is, and help others do the same.

## Feelings as Derivatives

As humans, we often turn to our feelings to validate our current desires, choices, or actions. Feelings act like the derivative of our lives—telling us not our position, but the rate of change. Are we trending upward or downward? For example, when deciding whether to continue dating someone, we might ask ourselves, "How do I feel when I'm around them?" If the feeling is good, we assume we're on the right track. If it's bad, we assume something's off.

But here's the catch: feelings in the moment can lie.

## The Running Paradox

One of the most common lies we fall for is that something unpleasant was actually enjoyable—because we only remember how we felt after it was over. Take running. People often say, "That run felt so good!" But if we rewind to the actual run, it was hard. It was hot. Their legs were sore. They wanted to quit. In the moment, they probably thought, "This sucks." The run itself had a negative derivative—but afterward, the feelings spike upward. What they really mean is: "That run was hard, but now I feel amazing."

The problem is that if we rely solely on feelings as real-time feedback, we often quit too early—right before the positive spike.

## Short-Term vs. Long-Term Feelings

Let's look at a few examples of short-term (ST) vs. long-term (LT) feelings:

### Being Wrong
- **ST:** Embarrassing, frustrating
- **LT:** Growth, humility, learning

### Learning Something New
- **ST:** Confusing, uncomfortable, disorienting
- **LT:** Confidence, intelligence, competence

### Being Christlike
- **ST:** Inconvenient, exhausting, awkward
- **LT:** Peace, joy, satisfaction, meaning

## The Need for Honesty

So maybe we need to talk about these things with more clarity—and more honesty.

This idea of "negative now, positive later" isn't new. It's another way of describing delayed gratification. But what I'm really pointing to is the need to be honest about the negative part. Because if we ignore it, we set people up for confusion and disappointment.

During General Conference, I often feel deeply inspired by stories of Christlike love, sacrifice, and obedience. But when I step out to try living that way—only to be hit with inconvenience, awkwardness, or rejection—I check in with my feelings... and they don't match the stories. The derivative feels wrong. So I stop. I abandon the good path because the short-term feelings don't confirm the long-term truth.

## The Real Secret

But what if we were more honest? What if we said: "Being Christlike often feels hard, awkward, or thankless at first—but it leads to something profoundly good." Then maybe we'd be more willing to endure the discomfort. We'd be less likely to confuse a negative slope with a wrong path.

Because this is the real secret: Godhood is built on the ability to walk uphill when it feels downhill. To see past the derivative. To trust the direction, even when the slope is steep. If we can be honest about the struggle—and still choose progression—we won't just avoid messing it up...

We'll keep moving forward toward divinity.
