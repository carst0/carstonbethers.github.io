## The Hidden Strategy

Here is what nobody talks about.

In America we have many problems, but one of our largest is the risk of a federal financial collapse, solved by printing money. 

While you might think we have elected an orange mad man, after looking at his plan, I think the current administration has positioned itself to try and avoid this potential fallout.

## The Simple Explanation

The current administration is trying to apply pressure (in various ways) on the Federal Reserve so they decrease interest rates, so we can refinance our national debt at a lower rate.

That's it. That's the plan.
