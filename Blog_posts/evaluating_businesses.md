When I first learned about entrepreneurship and started thinking through ideas I would often rate these ideas on the amount of excitement I had for it. As I saw things that I would perceive as cool, my enthusiasm grew and I would perceive the idea as better the more excited I got about it. For example, the first time I put a logo on a website I was enamored by it thinking “wow this really looks good! The logo I created is on an official website?? How cool! This is going to be a great business!”  But as I went on and have done this multiple times I have realized that these things should be seen as benefits and not key drivers for ranking. When thinking through business ideas it is important to take a step back and look at where it lands on the exciting-reality matrix. The difference between legit businesses and most business ideas is that legitimate businesses are in the low to medium excitement and medium to high reality quadrant of that matrix whereas most business ideas are in the high excitement, low reality quadrant.




So this is how I learned not to rate business ideas, but how should I rate it? This is the question I will be answering. Look at the thread called “Evaluating Businesses” to learn with me.
