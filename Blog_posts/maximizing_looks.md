*the following is not a blanket statement or even my opinion, but an idea I am seeking to refine through writing. 

It has been said, “You’re not ugly, you’re just poor.” While I think there are many things you can do with money to improve your looks, I also think the statement might have merit in reverse: “You’re not poor, you’re just ugly.” The first tells us that you can change your looks once you have money. The latter argues that by changing one's looks, they can make more money. Today, I want to dive into this train of thought and see if I can make any sense of it. I also add a few thoughts on Looksmaxxing at the end.

The precursor to success is exercising agency.

One of the first uses of agency is self-improvement.

Self-improvement means beautifying the human.

One has not fully taken advantage of agency until both the inside and the outside are beautified. 

So in a way, becoming a beautiful person is either a tangential preceding or accompanying event to success. 

- 

That might be wrong. Let me try again. 

- 

Attractive people get more opportunities. This is easy to see in college especially when one of your attractive friends tells you that she has dates every single day of the week and hardly has to buy or make dinner. 

I think this is because in a group of average people, the one with the opportunity to give has cognitive selection bias where their mind glazes over the average looking humans and picks out the attractive ones. I am pretty sure this is well documented. I mean, the more attractive president tends to win the race, especially in previous years where other information was not as widespread through technology.

If this is true, and one desires to be successful in life, then the logical step would be to take the body that God has given you and make it as beautiful as possible. This would include losing weight until you have a healthy BMI, eating healthily, taking care of your skin, exercising to build moderate muscle, improving the health/abundance of your hair, styling your hair, cutting your finger nails, wearing clothes that fit and are stylish, etc. This does not include wearing things that are oversexualized. At that point you move from improving your looks to being a subject of lust. Lust is not a precursor to success, it is often the opposite. 

- 

Let me give one more try.

- 

Attractive people, or maybe, people who consider themselves moderately to very attractive, have a higher level of confidence than others. They are more likely to ask someone on a date, they are more likely to post a picture of themselves online, they are more likely to promote their personal projects.
Success, especially now, has been said to be a function of the risk's you take, online and offline. I'd like to speak of online for a moment. 
What keeps individuals from putting themselves out there online? It's fear. Fear that someone might call them out for their specific insecurity in the comments section. These insecurities are often times physical. If you become attractive, and confident, you reduce or eliminate those insecurities. Then you will be more likely to take those risks online, and then you will at least have a chance for success!

I’m not entirely sure about this, but I think the idea has some merit.
There’s a difference between looksmaxxing and maximizing your looks. Looksmaxxing feels like an obsession—an urge to alter the canvas itself in pursuit of comparison and validation. Maximizing your looks, by contrast, is about working with the natural canvas and highlighting what makes you unique. One is rooted in comparison and self-worship; the other, ideally, is rooted in self-awareness and individuality.
