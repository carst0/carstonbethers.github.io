This was written in 45 mins. It is not thorough. 

I am realizing that the official responsibility of America’s politicians contributes to national debt and a weaker America. Their official duty is encapsulated in the following oath:

“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.”

There is no part of this oath that mandates long-term thinking. As a result, politicians act based on the question: “What can I do in office to get myself re-elected?” rather than “What can I do that will be of the greatest benefit to the United States, now and in the future?”

This is not necessarily a moral failing on their part but rather a rational response to the incentives of the political system. If even one politician prioritizes short-term personal or electoral gain over long-term national well-being, others will follow suit. This results in pork-barrel spending and omnibus bills that include everything from gender-affirming care and state project funding to military budgets. A useful analogy is sharing a cup of ice cream with a sibling: when one starts eating faster, the other speeds up in response, until the ice cream is gone without either of them having fully enjoyed it. In the political context, however, instead of merely finishing the ice cream, politicians can agree to make the cup bigger—at the expense of the national debt.

The decision-making process often follows this pattern: “I will vote for what is right for the United States… unless you offer me something that will help my re-election chances. If you do, I will forego my initial sentiment.” This cycle only ever leads to the federal government taking on more debt.

My concern is that there is no "captain of the ship" ensuring the long-term progress of the United States. There appears to be no governing body tasked with maintaining a strategic, long-term vision for the country. While one might argue that the Judicial Branch provides some stability, it primarily functions as a reactive body rather than a proactive force for progress. Consequently, our national trajectory changes every 4-8 years, with national debt being the only consistent area of growth.

There are many potential solutions to this problem. Here are a few ideas generated from five minutes of brainstorming. A true solution might involve one, some, or none of these proposals:

Amending the Oath of Office

Keep the existing oath but add language explicitly prioritizing the long-term welfare of the United States over immediate political or local interests. This could provide grounds for impeachment of officials who consistently put re-election above national interest.

Limiting Legislative Scope

Implement a cap on how many topics a single law can cover. This would ideally prevent omnibus bills and reduce the ability of politicians to trade votes on unrelated issues, leading to a more disciplined budget.

Randomized Political Teams

Force politicians to work in randomly assigned bipartisan teams that vote collectively on legislation. This could reduce party-line voting and encourage genuine negotiation.

The Warren Buffett Solution

Establish a budget cap based on the previous year’s tax revenue. If Congress fails to pass a balanced budget, all members are automatically removed from office. This aligns politicians' job security with the fiscal responsibility they currently lack. Unfortunately, this proposal is unlikely to ever be implemented because it directly challenges the incentives that keep politicians in power.

Ultimately, addressing the systemic issues within American politics requires structural reforms that change the incentives at play. Without such changes, short-term thinking will continue to dominate, and national debt will remain a persistent and growing problem.
