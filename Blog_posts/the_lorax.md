## Reframing The Story

Framing is important. When you do something good you give speeches and say, "I'd like to thank my Mom my Dad my friends, my gardenerâ€¦" When you do something terrible people say, "he was a terrible person who drove this company/community into the ground." The Once-ler is a victim of this sort of framing.

## Alternative Perspectives

Here are some alternative titles for this book:
- "The Once-ler Builds an Empire on Naivety"
- "The Importance of Mentors"
- "A Lorax Fails Diplomacy Class"
- "How Not to Deal with Threats"
- "Public Markets Value Thneeds Over Truffula Trees"

## Shared Responsibility

The Once-ler is painted as the villain who kills all the trees, but I would argue that he is only partially to blame. Who else is responsible?

- His business educators, who never taught him about sustainability
- His parents, who were blinded by money and supported his actions
- The public, who didn't check for sustainability measures before purchasing the Thneed
- The Lorax, who never tried to reason with the Once-ler and only ever criticized him, instead of coaching him toward a better path

This is important to remember when we are the ones gaining the trophies, and even more important when fault seems to land on a single individual. Give them grace.
