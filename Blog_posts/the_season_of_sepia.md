"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; …
 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; …
 … for there is a time … for every purpose and for every work."
 — Ecclesiastes 3:1–2, 4, 17

I love these verses from Ecclesiastes. They have always resonated with me, because my life has been made up of distinct seasons—each with its own rhythm, focus, and meaning.

Here are a few:

**High School** – When I spent almost every moment with my best friends Caden and Ryan.

**New York City** – Where I strengthened my miniscule testimony and learned to think bigger.

**Singapore** – Where I met some of my favorite people on earth, ate wonderful food, and shared the principles of the gospel with others.

**Summer of Learning 2024** – Where I stayed at the lakehouse and let learning and serendipity fill my days.

**First Three Years at BYU** – Where I spent all my time studying and having fun with my best friends Robbie and Brandon.

**Summer of Learning 2025** – Where I decided to build things every day, setting the stage for what comes next.

I've noticed something: I rarely recognize when a season is ending, but I almost always feel it when a new one begins.

Right now, I feel one beginning.

I've entered the **Season of Sepia**.

What started as a simple article-annotating tool has evolved into the beginnings of an AI-integrated Learning Management System. If I'm going to take this idea and truly change how students learn, I will need to create a startup, but not just any startup. Its going to have to be a dragon killer. Because to succeed, we will have to dethrone a billion-dollar behemoth.

It's a little daunting.

So, yeah—welcome to the Season of Sepia.

It's going to be hard. Harder than anything I've done before.
I'm going to feel great thrills and great disappointments.
I'm going to be stressed every day.
I'm going to change a lot.
I'm going to have to sacrifice things that might, in the end, be in vain.

But.

I'm going to do it.

John F. Kennedy once said:

> "We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people.
>  Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?
>  We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon… We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win…"

That's the spirit I'm bringing to this season.

It's time to build.
