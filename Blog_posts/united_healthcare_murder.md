## The Rise and Fall

Brian Thompson had risen from humble beginnings, a town of just 1,200 people, to become the CEO of a company with over 150,000 employees. He had once lived in the cave, in struggle, but had crawled out and brought back the good news: that success was possible. His life served as living proof that excuses, especially those rooted in naivety or difficult circumstances, could be overcome.

And that's why they killed him.

## The Real Threat

He was one of them, once. But now, he represented everything they refused to accept: responsibility, growth, and change. His success exposed the lies that people tell themselves to stay where they are. He became a threat to their way of life, not because he condemned them, but because his existence invalidated the comfort of complacency.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

At the root of it all, they didn't want to be lifted to a higher understanding. They didn't want transformation. They wanted acceptance, not just for who they are, but for who they choose to remain, indefinitely.

They twisted the phrase "God loves you exactly the way you are, but He loves you too much to leave you that way" into "God loves you exactly the way you are, and doesn't care if you stay that way."
