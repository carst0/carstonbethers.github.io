## AI and College: A Thought Experiment

Pop a pill and imagine this: Since childhood, you've dreamed of joining the Air Force to become a fighter pilot. Every man in your family—your brothers, your dad, even your great-grandpa—was a fighter pilot. It's the ultimate life: thrill, success, and service to your country. You've studied aerial maneuvers, memorized war tactics, and crushed it in Junior ROTC. Now, it's senior year of college, and your ROTC commander just handed you a pilot slot for the F-35. Everything is coming together exactly as you imagined.

Then, the heavens open, and the Second Coming of Christ happens.

The world unites in peace. No more war, no more conflict. It's a beautiful moment—until it hits you.

There will never be another dogfight. No recon missions, no training exercises. The need for fighter pilots is gone. Just like that, your entire purpose vanishes.

What do you do now?

Maybe the better question is: What will you not do?

You won't go back to ROTC class. You won't study aerial maneuvers. You won't waste a second thinking about war tactics because they no longer matter.

This is exactly what's happening to college students right now.

AI can already do most of the jobs that college grads are supposed to walk into. What happens when companies actually implement the tools that replace entry-level roles?

The logical answer: AI will take over low-level jobs, forcing students to either:

Start businesses
Jump levels through mentorship
Go into manual labor (until humanoid robots show up for those too)
Pursue even more education
End up unemployed
The realistic answer: It'll take longer than two years for this shift to happen across all industries. But some companies will move first, and others will drag their feet.

Take Goldman Sachs. Their CEO, David Solomon, recently said AI can now handle 95% of the work required for an IPO filing—something that, just a year ago, would've been done by a fresh college grad. That tells you exactly which side they're on.

My prediction? The companies that resist AI will be the ones still hiring. But those same companies will also be the first to collapse, simply because they won't be able to compete with AI-first businesses.

And yet, my professors don't seem the least bit worried.

AI can generate reports, design PowerPoints, run complex data analysis in seconds, and even manage people with the right training. Meanwhile, my professors are acting like everything is business as usual. It's like we're sinking into lava, and they're just telling us to buckle our seatbelts.

I don't have the answers.

All I know is that the hard skills I'm learning feel like a waste of time when I know AI can do them faster and better. The only classes that still feel worth it are the discussion-based ones—the ones where we read great books, challenge each other, and actually think.

Maybe I should just start a company.
